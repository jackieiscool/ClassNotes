How do we make sure people are accomplishing things?
How do we make sure people feel accomplished?

**Ideas:**  
- If we need to install things do it the night before.  
- Have clear instructions written out.  
- Make sure we push drections to github as we go.  

**Failing the Good Way**  
- Make sure we ask students what teaching style works best for them.
