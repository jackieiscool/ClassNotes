##Twitter Bootstrap

**website:**

Twitter bootstrap comes with pre-defined css classes. You only have to call on these classes, and the formatting will happen for you.  

example:  
		
		<div class="row-fluid" >

		#bootstrap has a class row-fluid in the css, with all the attributes defined for you.

Bootstrap also comes with jQuery plugins: http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/customize.html#plugins
