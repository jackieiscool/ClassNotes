#API KEYS

Keep your api keys in your .env file.  

		TWITTER_KEY = #put key here

add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.  

The gitignore file prevents certain pieces of our project from being added to our git repository.  
We add things like databases, and access to api keys to these files because these are things we want to keep private from the outside world.
